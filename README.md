## INTRODUCTION
In this project, we propose a system for detecting and monitoring forest fires using two cutting-edge deep learning algorithms (YOLO-v5 and Inception-v3), designed to detect fires at their earliest stages. This early warning system will critically analyse the scope of artificial intelligence, reduce the response time of fire authorities, and help them mitigate the loss of life and property caused by forest fires before they spread uncontrollably. This system will increase the reliability and accuracy of fire detection and monitoring operations and contribute to the overall sustainability and resilience of forest ecosystems.
Â 
## FEATURES
- Includes real-time monitoring feature, using YOLO algorithm for early detection and rapid response to wildfires
- Include Location Tracker feature, in which GPS tracker is implemented to track the area and location of fire
- Include Fire Alerts Reports feature, which generate instant reporting for timely decision-making and effective fire record management
- Utilize the Inception v3 deep learning model in model prediction feature, to accurately detect and classify smoke, fire and non fire
- Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of forest management and firefighting operations
